title: About the Black Death Digital Archive
---

In April 2019, a group of scholars including historians, archeologists, anthropologists, and paleogeneticists met at the Harvard Radcliffe Institute for an exploratory seminar entitled “Biraben 2.0: A Black Death Digital Archive.” In attendance were leading plague researchers who had come together to think about how scientific data and historical accounts of the Second Plague Pandemic could be brought together in a collective evidentiary platform for research in all disciplines.

This site is a direct outgrowth of that seminar.
