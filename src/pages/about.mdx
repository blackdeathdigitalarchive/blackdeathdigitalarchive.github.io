# History of the BDDA

In the past decade, the BDDA project participants have pioneered new approaches to the history of plague during the Second Plague Pandemic, the 500-year period in which new strains of plague spread throughout most of the Old World. This “new paradigm” in plague studies has readily adopted the evolutionary perspective on the history of Yersinia pestis as a pathogenic organism as put forward by biologists working from both phylogenetic (evolutionary) and palaeogenetic (aDNA retrieval) perspectives. Now, instead of “plague” functioning as a generic term for any kind of epidemic disease, or even a sustained catastrophe of some sort (e.g., the ten Biblical “Plagues of Egypt”), plague—the disease caused by the bacterium Y. pestis— has become a biologically verifiable entity in human history. Plague can now be tracked with precision through space and time, thus creating a narrative of the pathogen’s effects on societies as distinct as Bronze Age Eurasia, the late medieval Mongol Empire, early modern East Africa and India, and the modern American West.
 
However, the history of the micro-organism only tells one part of the history of plague as a disease. The rest of the story must be told by putting the biology into dialogue with what we can learn from documentary and archaeological sources about the actual causes of epidemic and pandemic events, and the effects of such phenomena on human populations. Over the last decade, our team members (individually or collaboratively) have spearheaded this new approach to plague history in their scholarship. BDDA is a natural outgrowth of our joint efforts to make this new paradigm accessible to a larger community.


Initial discussions about the BDDA first started in 2018 ……  

In April 2019, a two-day exploratory seminar (“Biraben 2.0: A Black Death Digital Archive”) organized by Monica H. Green and Joris Roosen and was held at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study to discuss the basic structure of the BDDA project. The participants:…

In summer 2019, Nükhet Varlık started to organize the collection of data from the Ottoman archives with the help of BDDA project assistant Mesut Sayan and supported by a five-year SSHRC Insight Grant for “Rewriting Plague’s Second Pandemic: History Meets Science.” Nükhet Varlık, Ece Turnator, and Mesut Sayan (in consultation with DH consultants/Pelagios/Jamie) developed the basic organization of data using AirTable.

In Fall 2020, Monica Green, Nükhet Varlık, and Tunahan Durmaz received a “Covid-19 Grant for History in the Public Interest from Villanova University Albert Lepage Center for History in the Public Interest for the project “Reconceiving the History of Plague in the Era of COVID-19.” This project, currently under way during 2020-2021 organizes translations of sources on infectious diseases in the Islamicate World. This grant helped lay out the structure for the organization of the History of Infectious Disease in the Islamicate World Working Group (HIDIW), hosted by the Consortium for History of Science, Technology, and Medicine (CHSTM). HIDIW Working Group currently has XX members and meets once a month to discuss sources on the infectious diseases in the Islamicate World.

In Spring 2021, the BDDA partnered with AGILE Humanities for web development, supported by the University of South Carolina, College of Arts and Sciences …
