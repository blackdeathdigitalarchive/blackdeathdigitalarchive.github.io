BDDA has been awarded a special commendation by the CARMEN Medieval Network for its promise as an innovative digital project. The judges were impressed with the cross-national reach of the project (both in terms of the research team itself as well as the global reach of their work), its potential to advance scholarly and public understanding of the second plague pandemic through the creation of a multidisciplinary web portal, and its exciting integration of Medieval Studies with the burgeoning field of the Medical Humanities. (For the announcement of award, see https://arc-humanities.org/carmen/project-prize.)
 
BDDA is a partner of the Pelagios Network
 
Pelagios is a research community that “connects researchers, scientists and curators to link and explore the history of places,” organized by experts dedicated to advancing the use of digital technologies in the humanities. The network offers an invaluable service to scholars and students by facilitating access to research and engaging scholars, students, and the general public in unprecedented ways. One of the areas Pelagios assumes a leadership role is in Linked Open Data (LOD); it offers a set of tools through its various platforms to register, visualize, and annotate linked data. In addition, the network encourages collaboration among scholars and promotes the use of LOD for students and the broader community.
