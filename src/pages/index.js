	    <p>BDDA is a multidisciplinary project to integrate historical accounts of the Black Death with modern bio-archeological and paleogenomic research.</p>

	    <h2>Grounded in the Semantic Web</h2>
	    <p>We are developing an ontology that draws on existing representations of knowledge in science and the humanities so that we can build a knowledge base of linked open data that integrates scientific data and historical evidence.</p>

	    <h2>Fundamentally Interdisciplinary</h2>
	    <p>We are working with the interdisciplinay community of historians, archeologists, and paleogenetic scientists to identify and compile research data into an interoperable, linked-data format.</p>

	    <h2>Community Oriented</h2>
	    <p>We intend to develop a repository of linked data that is freely available for scholars and students of all disciplines to use in their own research.</p>
