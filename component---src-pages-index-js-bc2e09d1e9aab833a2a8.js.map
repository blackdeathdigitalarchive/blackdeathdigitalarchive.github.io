An evolutionary history of the causative organism of plague, Yersinia pestis, allows us now to track plagueâ€™s movements across vast landscapes and demonstrate the connected stories linking outbreaks from China to Spain to sub-Saharan Africa. Just as the geographical footprint of the Second Plague Pandemic has grown, so, too, has its chronological scope. We can now demonstrate that a sustained proliferation of strains of Y. pestis started in the late 12th or early 13th century, and lasted up to the 19th century. Researching such a vast phenomenon demands the combined labors of scientists and historians. This project serves as a portal for researchers from all disciplinary backgrounds, allowing them to find the best methodological work with links to biological, archaelogical, and documentary databases.</p>\n\n    <p>\n      <Link to=\"/about/\">More about the project</Link>\n    </p>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\n\n\nexport default IndexPage\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
