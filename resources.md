title: BDDA Resources
---
The two-day Radcliffe seminar ("Biraben 2.0: A Black Death Digital Archive") established the framework for the BDDA.  Central to the seminar's concerns was the importance of data reclamation:

>    we must first reclaim over two centuries of written data produced by historians and epidemiologists alike.

The medium of this reclamation must be amenable not only to human researcher but to computational agents as well.  Machine-readable text is very important, of course, but it is not by itself sufficient, especially in the case of primary sources, which come in a variety of languages, some of them archaic or obscure, and many of which are, like many historical accounts, unreliable to varying degrees.

The BDDA is therefore focused on deriving machine-readable expressions of the meaning carried in primary-source documents.  Knowledge representation has long been central to computer science and artificial intelligence, and it has undergone a renaissance in recent years with the emergence of the semantic web, linked open data, and infrastructures for knowledge graphs.

The Radcliffe seminar illuminated the centrality of data modeling and knowledge representation to the project of achieving consilience:  modeling evidence of plague.  By establishing a common ontology, the BDDA will support many of the goals outlined by the Radcliffe Seminar:
  
* it will enable the multifaceted study of human disease in general, plague in particular

* it will enable researchers in various fields to discover connections among their data and supporting data from other disciplines

The BDDA has concentrated on the CIDOC CRM as a primary source for its ontology, and it has produced an exploratory encoding of data from the Ottoman archives and from Biraben's magisterial and controversial work, *les hommes et la peste en France et dans les pays méditerranéens*. 

You can find this work-in progress, as well as other knowledge graphs and tutorials, in the BDDA github repository at <https://github.com/blackdeathdigitalarchive/knowledge-graphs>.
