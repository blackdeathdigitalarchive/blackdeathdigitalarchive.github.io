title: BDDA Resources
---

The BDDA is focused on deriving machine-readable expressions of the meaning carried in primary-source documents.  Knowledge representation has long been central to computer science and artificial intelligence, and it has undergone a renaissance in recent years with the emergence of the semantic web, linked open data, and infrastructures for knowledge graphs.

The BDDA has concentrated on the CIDOC CRM as a primary source for its ontology, and it has produced an exploratory encoding of data from the Ottoman archives and from Biraben's magisterial and controversial work, *les hommes et la peste en France et dans les pays méditerranéens*.
